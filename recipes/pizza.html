    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pizza is a crowd-pleasing choice for busy weeknights and fun weekend
      dinners alike. But you don't have to rely on restaurants or takeout for
      top-notch pizza. Read on for tips on how to make your own pizza at home.
      We'll walk you through how to make pizza crust, how to top a pizza, pizza
      baking temperature, and how long to bake pizza. Plus, we'll share some of
      our favorite homemade pizza recipes to try.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active-dry yeast</li>
      <li>10 ounces unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine and stir water and yeast in a mixing bowl until mixture
        resembles miso soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour and salt to mixture and mix until dough just comes together.
        Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough until the flour is incorporated, about five minutes or
        until it is smooth and elastic. The dough should be moist and slightly
        tacky. (If it's sticky, add in more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until
        smooth).
      </li>
      <li>
        Evenly divide dough in half and refrigerated one half for another time
        or double the topping recipe to make two 10-inch pizzas. If you would
        rather make individual pizza pies, portion the dough into as many round
        balls as you want pies. Once the portions have been formed, cover and
        let the dough sit for five to 10 minutes to allow the gluten to relax
        before rolling the dough out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease a sheet of parchment paper with olive oil. Or, you can
        use cornmeal to dust the surface of your work area to keep the dough
        from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer ball of dough to parchment. Stretch out dough by hand as much
        as possible, then lightly brush with olive oil, cover with another piece
        of parchment. Another approach is to pound the dough down with your fist
        or the palm of your hand — this is just a preliminary shaping, to form
        the dough ball into a disc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a rolling pin (this adjustable rolling pin has over 1,300 5-star
        reviews on Amazon) and work from the middle of the dough outward to
        flatten dough to ¼ inch thickness. For those of you that like a thicker
        crust, roll the dough to your desired thickness. Using a rolling pin
        (rather than your fingers) will help maintain a consistent thickness.
